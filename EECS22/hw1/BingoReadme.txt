My program opens and reads the file in the main function.
After the main function reads the file, the values from the file are stored into variables.
These variables are then passed onto another function called bingoCalled where the function cehcks if the called number matches the Bingo Board.
I was told that it was okay to mark my numbers with -1 and not color it so for every matched number, I changed that value in the 3D array to -1.
Everytime a number matched, I used a counter and counted once.
If the counter equaled the board size, then that means someone won.
I finally printed the Bingo winners and exited the program since the game is over.
