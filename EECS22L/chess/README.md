## Changes made from Alpha Release:
Compared to our Alpha Release, we were able to finish some typo issues in our print statements and also fixed our user inputs to become more user friendly. The Alpha Release of our program asked the user to input two numbers indicating the row and column in the 2-D array. Now the program will ask for a proper input using the chess board ("a1", "b2"). We've also completed the movement for all our pieces for its legal and illegal moves. The AI and special mvoes function have begun implementation but is still under work. 

## Changes made from Beta Release:
Implememnted check, checkmate, all special moves, and AI (for PvC and CvC modes). Fixed all illegal moves.
